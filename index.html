                    <p>My name is Valentin and I'm <span id="age"></span> years old Bulgarian Economics and Computer Science student and hobbyist.
                        My enthusiasm for computers and technology is since my childhood. I liked playing with computer gadgets, finding out how they work, trying to break them and find a way to fix them.
                        My interest in software development started around <span id="coding-since"></span> years ago.
                        It was during the middle of my second semester at university, where the first two years we study Economy and the next two Computer Science.
                        Since I had a lot of free time, I decided not to waste it and wait for the third year to start programming, but do it right away.
                        So like every new to programming person, I went over the internet look for the best computer language.
                        Mission impossible, right?
                        There is no such thing as best or suitable programming language and  are a lot of opinions depending on person to person and their experience.
                        I decided to start with C, as it was said it is very difficult to learn and what a better challenge?
                        Well, I didn't get to the difficult parts though (i.e. memory management, pointers, etc.), because I had to move on with another language, more suitable for professional development.
                        I went on learning C# and .NET technologies which got me more involved with programming and then I decided I should take courses in programming to speed up my learning and start doing some real stuff, apart from my regular curriculum at university.
                        So I signed up for programming courses at the Software University - one of the biggest private software schools in the country.
                        There I found my passion with software engineering, as I started seeing how all the different parts in software come together to make something bigger and useful.
                        I also had experience with three more languages - Java, JavaScript, PHP, but what really helped me learn programming was the curiosity to find out what I can do with the knowledge I gather and the constant motivation to achieve new goals.
                        I started developing my own little side projects in attempt to find out how things work and seeing my ideas come to life just made and makes me feel happy about what I do.<br/>
                        Nowadays I keep learning new stuff as Computer Science is one endless ever growing field.
                        In May 2018 I started my first job in <a href="http://vida-soft.com/">VIDA Software Ltd.</a> - a small software company where me and three very experienced senior developers build software solutions for the enterprise using the Java Enterprise Edition technology stack.
                        Throughout my work I have improved my teamwork and communication skills, learned a lot about the the process of building a software for the enterprise, AGILE development and of course made new friendships.
