                    <p>My name is Valentin and I'm 21 years old Bulgarian Computer Science student and hobbyist. My
                        enthusiasm for
                        computers came since I was a child. I liked playing with computer gadgets, breaking stuff and
                        trying
                        to find how to fix it
                        but my passion towards software came to me recently (about two years ago). It was during the
                        middle
                        of my second semester at university
                        where the first two years we study Economy and the next two Computer Science. Since I was having
                        a
                        lot of free time so
                        I decided not to wait for the third year to start programming but do it right away. So like
                        every
                        new to programming person
                        started, I started looking over the internet to find the best computer language. There were a
                        lot of
                        opinions but I chose to start with C, as
                        people were saying if is very difficult but it teaches you a lot. I didn't get to the difficult
                        parts though (i.e. memory management, pointers etc.),
                        because I had to move on with another language, more suitable for my needs. I went on learning
                        C#
                        which got me more involved
                        with programming and then I decided I should take courses in programming apart from my regular
                        curriculum at university.
                        I went to programming courses at the Software University - one of the biggest private software
                        schools in the country. And there I found my passion
                        with software engineering as I started seeing how all the different parts in software come
                        together
                        to create something bigger and useful. There I also had experience with
                        three more languages - Java, JavaScript, PHP. But what really helped learn programming was my
                        curiosity for the things
                        I can do with the knowledge I gain. I started developing my own little projects in attempt to
                        find
                        out how things work and
                        seeing my ideas come to live made and still makes the experience I gain out of software
                        development
                        an awesome one.<br>
                        Nowadays I still continue to learn new things as Computer Science is one endless ever growing
                        field.
